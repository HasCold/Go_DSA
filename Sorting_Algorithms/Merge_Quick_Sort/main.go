// ### 2. **Efficient Sorting Algorithms**
//    - **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array, sorts, and merges. Time complexity is O(n log n).
//    - **Quick Sort**: Also a divide-and-conquer algorithm, but uses a pivot to partition the array. Generally faster than merge sort but has O(nÂ²) worst-case time complexity (usually avoided by choosing good pivots).
//    - **Heap Sort**: Uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements. Has O(n log n) time complexity and is in-place, but not stable.

// Merge , Quick and Heap Sort maninly works on your O(nlogn) Time Complexity
